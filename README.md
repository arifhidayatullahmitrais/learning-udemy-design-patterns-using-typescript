## What is OOP (https://cloudaffle.com/series/object-oriented-typescript/introduction-to-oop/)

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of objects as a way to structure and organize code.

* Abstraction is the process of simplifying system by breaking the down into smaller, more manageable components.
* Encapsulation promotes the separation of concerns and data hiding, making it easier to reason about, maintain, and reuse code.
* Polymorphism is a fundamental concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass
